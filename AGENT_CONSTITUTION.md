# Agent Constitution

This document outlines lifecycle policies for all agents.

## Lifecycle Stages

- **prototype**: experimental agents for sandbox use only.
- **stable**: production-ready agents with tests and docs.
- **deprecated**: maintained for backward compatibility only.
- **archived**: inactive agents kept for reference.

Each agent in `config/agents.json` must specify its lifecycle stage.
